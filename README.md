# Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
This project focused on designing and assembling three ground robots to study how multiple agents can learn to work together in a shared environment. Each robot was built from scratch using Arduino and included encoders, IMUs, and ultrasonic sensors for motion tracking and obstacle detection. I developed a control system that handled movement, communication, and decision-making in real time. To make the robots more reliable, I also built a Bayesian framework to model how different failures could occur and affect learning.

## Files in this Repository

### Folder: `Arduino files`

* Contains the Arduino sketches to be uploaded to the robots.
* Each file is labeled for the respective robot.
* Robot 3 has **two versions**: open loop control and closed loop control (not sure which one works best).
* All files include comments and documentation.

### Folder: `Development files`

* Contains code and scripts used during development and hardware testing.
* **Mainly for debugging purposes.**
* You do **not** need any file from this folder to run the robots or the trained model.

### File: `list of failure causes.md`

* Lists the failure modes, effects, and causes.
* Also includes the probabilities used to train the reinforcement learning model.

### File: `precautions.md`

* Lists important precautions related to the robot and hardware.
* Covers all major components used in the robots.

### File: `coordinate_control.py`

* This is the Python script used to send coordinates to the robot.
* The same script is used for all three robots â€” **only the COM port needs to be updated**.

### File: `what to do.md`

* Step-by-step guide for connecting the Bluetooth modules.
* Also explains which code to run and in what order.
